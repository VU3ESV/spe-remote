"""Power on/off control for SPE Expert amplifiers.

Power ON:  DTR hardware line toggle (no serial command exists for power on).
           Uses the *existing* serial_handler port — opening a second
           pyserial Serial() on the same tty toggles DTR/RTS as a side
           effect of pyserial's default termios configuration, which on
           the second power-action wedges the FTDI driver.
Power OFF: Serial command 0x0A (SWITCH OFF) per SPE Application Programmer's
           Guide Rev 1.1 for Expert 1.3K-FA / 1.5K-FA / 2K-FA.

Note: When DTR is held high the amplifier's front-panel power switch is
overridden ("POWER SWITCH HELD BY REMOTE" warning). The startup takes
3-4.5 seconds after DTR is raised.
